# Lecture Notes

## What's new in 301?
- Warm-ups
  - in multiple languages (python, C#, Java, React, JS)
- Code Challenges
  - 6-10ish short word problems/algorithms 
  - see shred talks if you learn well from video demo
  - first introduction to formal testing and TDD
  - practice for interviews
- More pair programming
- Career Coaching
  - More career assignments
- Lab Assignments
  - Trello for a lot of weekly project work flow
- Grading standards
  - Turn in your Labs and Retros!
  - Take care of your TAs by following instructions posted by Phil every week in Slack
  - Resubmissions allowed up until Project Week(s) start


### How to succeed
- turn in EVERY assignment - very easy to fall behind
  - even if it is not done
- career assignments and reading open
- work with others
- 15 minute rule


# Classes 
- Classes are the building blocks for React
  - They are part of ES6 and allow for Object Oriented Programming
- A blueprint for creating objects
  - A system where we can define objects in relation to each other using subclasses using the keyword extends.
- [Classes](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Classes) on MDN 


## Arrow Functions
- multiple ways to create a function
  - mostly been doing function declarations in 201
  - function expresions are another way and arrow functions are one way to write a function expression 
- function expression vs. declaration
  - Function declarations load before any code is executed while Function expressions load only when the interpreter reaches that line of code.
  - Similar to the var statement, function declarations are hoisted to the top of other code. Function expressions arenâ€™t hoisted, which allows them to retain a copy of the local variables from the scope where they were defined.
  - benifits of function expressions
    - in closures - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qikxEIxsXco
    - as an argument to another function
    - to immediately invoke your funciton
- allow us to write concise one line functions
- the contextual this is not bound to the function if you use an arrow function, it will bubble up to the next non-arrow function

## React and Component-Based UI
### Why?
- React is hugely in demand in the industry
- Component based architecture is easier to test and reuse
- dynamicly updates application state without requiring a page reload
- dev advantages
  - reusable parts
  - separation of concerns
### What?
- React (angular and vue) are component based libraries that allow us to build applications using this technique
- Bind state/data to the DOM, they update the dom for us!!
  - react rerenders content when state changes by using a Virtual DOM
- We treat components like they are html elements `<Header />`
- Modularity
  - each component is it's own module, or block of code, that we can make available in another component
  - export the component from it's file, and import it where you want to use it
    - you can also import css and other files to a component module
### How
- WRRC
  - a request is made in the address bar for our website resource and the files are served
  - who is the client, who is the server?
- Use `npx create-react-app <application_name>` to start your project
- refer to the reactAppRemove.md if you want to clean up the file structure before you start
- JSX (syntax extension) allows us to write html markup in javascript 


## Code Challenges
- Daily "Shred Talks" introduce the student to a new javascript coding concept, setting them up to complete the daily "Code Challenge" series.

- How to...
  - don't forget to work on a new branch
    - `git checkout -b <new branch name>`
  - how to download the challenge
    - `npm run get-challenge 01`
  - how to run tests
    - `npm test`
    - `npm test challenges-01`
  - how to open stretch goals
    - remove the `x` in front of the keyword `describe` on the test you are trying to pass
