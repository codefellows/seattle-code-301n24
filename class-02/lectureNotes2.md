All times listed below are for Pacific Standard Time zone.

## Lecture & Lab Demo 6:30-8:30pm
- Props is an object, special to React, that allows us to pass data down from parent components via a custom attribute on the child component. 
- The child component can access that data using `this.props.attributeName` syntax.
- State is a special property we inherit from React.Component.
- State is an object, that is a property of the class component it is initalized inside of. 
- State acts like a global variable, holding a "snapshot" of the data in it's current condition.
- Bootstrap React
  - a third party component library we can use to import pre-styled components
  - components just like any other component we would make, but with styling already added
  - steps:
    - go to the Bootstrap React web docs
    - click "Getting Started"
    - grab installation script from the beginning of the page
      - run that in the root of your project
    - see further down on the page where it tells you to `import 'bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css';` and add that line to your index.js
    - then explore the component library to see which components you want to use and figure out how to use them
    - check out the component's API for additional attributes
