# Lecture Notes from Saturday 12/18/2021
All times listed below are for Pacific Standard Time zone.

## Feedback Overview 9:00-9:30am
- "Get rid of career assignments"
  - Code Fellows Alumni have reported back the value in these assignments. Everyone working in tech can code, but not every one has the professionalism to make it past the soft skills interview. 
- "TA was having trouble remembering the things that I needed help with"
  - If a TA is struggling with your bug, come get me! That is what I am here for!
- "It's going really quickly"
  - Yes! We teach at an accelerated rate to get you job-ready as fast as possible! Don't forget ask for help along the way.
  - Tutoring program: tutoring@codefellows.com
- "I'm not a big fan of reading notes"
  - If reading is not your style of learning, I am ok if you subsitute the reading for another method of learning that also introduces you to the new topic. 
  - If you need help finding material that is equivalent, please let me know. 
- "I was expecting more explanation about React itself"
  - Dang! I missed the mark on this one!
  - React is a JavaScript library created by Facebook.
  - React is a User Interface (UI) library, meaning we use React for front-end development.
  - React is a tool for building UI components.
  - React is a great templating library.
    - Class/objects are also great for templating.
  - Facebook has created a `Create React Application` with everything you need to build a React app.
    - It is a a development server that uses Webpack to compile React, JSX, and ES6, auto-prefix CSS files.
    - The `Create React App` uses ESLint to test and warn about mistakes in the code.
  - For a deeper dive into the CRA file structure, check out my [notes](./react-directory.md)!
- "I didn't like the video on state vs props for one of our reading assignments because it didn't have any code examples and it was hard to understand what he was talking about because everything was brand new and abstract."
  - If a reading or video isn't "clicking" with you, try to look for other resources that may better explain the new concept. 
  - If all else fails, you can always ask your new accountability buddy, ask a TA or ask me!
- "Since we haven't really dealt with scripts before I wish there was more information on what they do."
  - Everything we have been working in since 102 has been scripts!
  - If you aren't sure what a certain git command does, you can always either look it up or just ask me! 
  - Start a repo or gist with all the new commands and scripts that you have learned so that you can refer back on them later when you need to.
- "I ran get challenge command for my code challenge twice because I thought that you need to do it every time you work on your code challenge"
  - You only need to run the `npm run get-challenge 03` command once to get all the challenges you are working on for that day. 
  - You do NOT need to run this command more than once when working in the same file.
  - You will only get a new challenge when we start a new class day.
- "Similar thing happened with npx create-react-app command."
  - You only need to "create" a new React app once when working on the same project. 
  - You will need to create a new React app when you start a brand new project.
- "feedback provided in any assignment needs to be specific"
  - Joshua's feedback has mostly been pretty spot on. If you are not sure what he is trying to suggest, please ask either me or him for clarification. 
  - I am happy to take a look at your work and help you reach the grade you are hoping for.
- "I waited for 48 hours (after asking twice) for clarification.  My request for clarification was ignored"
  - The hard thing about this one is that Canvas does not notify me or Joshua when a student sends us a comment back. That means that we have to manually go through everyone's assignments and look for these comments. 
  - If you are asking for clarification, it might be better to ask us on Slack so we can respond in a timely fashion.
- "you can not ACP until you are really done with Code Challenge.  ACPing prior to be done, forces you to start over."
  - This is simply not true. I actually encourage you to ACP after you complete and pass each Code Challenge. 
  - If you are losing your work after you ACP, please let me know because something has gone very wrong.
- "As a full time employee, and a part time student in this bootcamp, I am not happy doing (something petty or extra for a resubmission)"
  - That's fair. I know that most of yall are working full time to support your families while you make this career change. 
  - The easiest answer is to talk to me. We want you to pass this class and we want you to be successful. It's hard to be succesful if you are stressing over tiny things that are not going to make or break your career. So please come talk to me about these things and I am happy to find a compromise. 
- "Getting off topic is disruptive"
  - Yup. I totally agree. I promise to continue to try to keep us on topic as we move through these lessons.
  - It's the student's job to remain focused on the scope of that day's lesson.
  - If you are curious about something deeper than what we are currently lecturing about, message me on Slack about it. I'd love to learn something new with you!


## Review Today's Calendar 9:30-10:00am
- Review: Quiz #1
  - You can re-take as many times as you like.
- Career: Accountability Partners
- Career: Partner Power Hour, Report #1
- Lab: Class 03
- Retro: Class 03
  - DUE BY MIDNIGHT TONIGHT! 


## Lab-03 Demo 10:00-12:00pm
- Feature #1: Display a Modal
  - Import the data.json file into your App component and send that data into the Main component
  - Map over the JSON data in your Main component to render each beast
  - Send a function into your Main component that allows the user to update state in the App
  - Create a SelectedBeast component and include it in your App
  - Use the state in the App to render an individual beast in a Modal in the SelectedBeast component using React Boothstrap
- Pasing functions in React
  - Allows us to do something in a child component that will trigger behavior in the parent component.
  - Useful for writing a function in the parent that updates state, and passing it as props to the child. The action of changing state still occurs in the parent, even if the child triggers it and/or passes arguments.
  - This is called "lifting state" in React.
