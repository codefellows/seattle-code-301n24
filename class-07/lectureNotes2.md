# Lecture Notes from Wednesday 01/05/2022
All times listed below are for Pacific Standard Time zone.


## Feedback due TONIGHT!
Thank you all for filling these out every week! Don't forget to do it again tonight! The more feedback you give me, the better I can make the course for you. We will review feedback from the holiday weeks this Saturday.


## Recovering from the Holidays
Thursday will be our lab day for class 07. We will resume our normal lab schedule on Saturday.  


## Lecture & Lab Demo 6:30-8:30pm
- Have you gotten your WeatherBit.io API key yet?
  - You can find the docs for this in the Class 07 Reading assignment.
  - You won't need the weather key today but you will need it on Saturday!
- Set up Server Repo
  - Our focus today will be on how the client connects to the server, with the client driving the requirements.
- Weather (placeholder data): As a user of City Explorer, I want to see weather info for the city I searched, so that I know how to pack for an upcoming trip.
  - We are using dummy data to set up our request to the weather API. This is a normal senario for a backend developer. A frontend team will detail what the response data should look like and it's the backend team's job to make it happen with any API data that it uses.
  - We will be wiring our backend up to use real API data on Saturday.  
- Errors (revisited): As a user, I want clear messages if something goes wrong so I know if I need to make any changes or try again in a different manner.
  - What happens if an API call goes wrong?


## Remo Lab 8:30pm-9:30pm
- Take this time to start on your lab from Class-07 with your partner(s).
  - You are working with same partners from lab 06.
- One dev will drive while the other navigates. 
- Switch driver/navigator roles in between Trello card completions. 
- This lab is due no later than Saturday, January 8th by 9:00am(PST).
