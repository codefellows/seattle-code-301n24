# Facilitators Guide: React and Component Based Architecture

## Overview

This first lecture of 301 is where the students received a brief introduction the course, educational team, and some basic lab fundamentals.

We will be covering a lot more of School and Class mechanics during the first 2 segments of class, with kickoff, introductions, and expectations taking the lions share of the day.

You will finish by introducing React and the idea of components using `create-react-app`.

## Learning Objectives

Review the detailed objectives in today's [student-facing readme](../README.md).

## Preparation

- Review React Components and Classes
- Prepare a 10-15 demonstration to introduce the topic of today's code challenges.

## Lecture Outline

One possible way to present this material is documented in the [example lecture](./LECTURE-EXAMPLE.md) notes.

## Lab Notes

## What changed from the previous class?

Nothing! Day One.

## What might students struggle with today?

There is a lot more work in 301 than in 201. Students will struggle with time management - especially in getting their code challenges completed.

This is also the first time they have used tests and might struggle to get their code to pass the tests.
