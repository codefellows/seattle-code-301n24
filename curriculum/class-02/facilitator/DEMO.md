# react-bootstrap

**Code:** `demo/`

Now that we have working code for our Tic-Tac-Toe board, it is time to style it.

Go the the react-bootstrap docs and explain to students what Bootstrap is and why we want to use it.

Play around with bringing in different Bootstrap elements and diving into the docs to see how we can configure each element to get it looking the way we want. Make sure you discuss how we can make this page responsive using react-bootstrap.
