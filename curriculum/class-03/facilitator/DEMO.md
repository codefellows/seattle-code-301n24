# Demos: readJSON and Bootstrap

## read JSON

**Code:**: `demo/readJSON`

Begin by bringing up the pain points of yesterday's lab. Ask students what they found repetitive and remind them that good code is DRY (dont' repeat yourself). Students should recognize that manualy entering in each argument to render a `hornedBeast` was super repitive and required a lot of copy and paste.
