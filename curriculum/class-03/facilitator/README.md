# Facilitators Guide: Passing Functions as Props

## Overview

Today will introduce several concepts which will lead to several refactors of the lab assignment. For example, students will style their applications using Bootstrap and will add filter functionality.

## Learning Objectives

Review the detailed objectives in today's [student-facing readme](../README.md).

## Preparation

- Practice [the demo](../demo/passing-functions)
- Practice [the demo](../challenges/DEMO.md) to introduce the topic of today's code challenges.

## Lecture Outline

One possible way to present this material is documented in the [example lecture](./LECTURE-EXAMPLE.md) notes.

## Lab Notes

- This is a big lab. Encourage students to spend time drawing their lab out before they begin. You might even draw it out with them before class is over

## What changed from the previous class?

- In the last class, students passed information in props. This class, students learned how to pass functions in props.

## What might students struggle with today?

- The concept of passing functions in props is really challenging

## Past bugs, issues or surprises...

## General Comments and Notes

- Code review might be a great time to tie in the WRRC today. The more you can reinforce this concept and slowly build upon it the better.
