# Facilitators Guide: Form Components in React

## Overview

## Learning Objectives

Review the detailed objectives in today's [student-facing readme](../README.md).

## Preparation

## Lecture Outline

Below is the expected lecture outline and flow. One possible way to present this material is documented in the [example lecture](../facilitator/LECTURE-EXAMPLE.md) notes.

### Warm-Up

- **Student Analysis** (5 min)
  - Show or print the [warm-up code](../warm-up/warm-up.md)
- **Debrief** (5-10 min)
  - Refer to the [Warmup Notes](../warm-up/NOTES.md)
  - Optionally demo the running code at Repl.it

### Shred Talk - .sort()

- **Why**
  - Daily "Shred Talks" introduce the student to a new javascript coding concept, setting them up to complete the daily "Code Challenge" series
- **What**
  - Refer to the [challenge documentation](../challenges/README.md)
- **How** (10 min)
  - Follow the [Demo Code](../challenges/DEMO.md)
- **Note**
  - If you are short on time, this can be omitted from class lecture. There are official videos that students can watch in lieu of you leading this portion of class.

### Code Review

### Forms and Modals

- See the associated [warmup](../demo/forms-warmup) and [demo](../demo/forms-demo).
  - To run these, start with the warmup markdown file. Have students work in small groups to read the HTML and write the JS code.
  - After the students have mostly finished, review the solution together inside of the HTML and JS files.
  - Next, build up a demo of integrating the same exact event handlers into a React application. Show the differences in how we update state to render information.
  - Lastly, incorporate `react-bootstrap` and show how we can use a `Form` and `Form.Control` in the same way we would use a plain HTML `form` and `input`. (If possible, show how using the exact same event listener works for a React Bootstrap form or a plain HTML form.)

## Lab Notes

## What changed from the previous class?

## What might students struggle with today?

- Students may not remember how event handlers work. Expect a lot of time for review of event handlers, in addition to adding them into our React app.

## Past bugs, issues or surprises...
