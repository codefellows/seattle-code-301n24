# Facilitators Guide: Form Components in React

## Overview

Today deals with one of the biggest headaches in React: forms. Spend some time why we use onChange vs onSubmit and the differences between vanilla JS forms and React forms.

## Learning Objectives

Review the detailed objectives in today's [student-facing readme](../README.md).

## Preparation

- Practice the [lab demo](../demo) and do a refresh on forms in vanilla JS vs forms in React.
- Practice [the code challenge demo](../challenges/DEMO.md) to introduce the topic of today's code challenges.

## Lecture Outline

One possible way to present this material is documented in the [example lecture](../facilitator/LECTURE-EXAMPLE.md) notes.

## Lab Notes

## What changed from the previous class?

- Today students will be collecting information in a form and passing that inforamtion to the parent who will then pass it to a different child component. 

## What might students struggle with today?

- Students may not remember how event handlers work. Expect a lot of time for review of event handlers, in addition to adding them into our React app.

## Past bugs, issues or surprises...
