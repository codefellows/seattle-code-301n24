# Facilitators Guide: CONDITIONAL RENDERING AND BROWSER ROUTER

## Overview

Today's class has a lot of built in flexibility to do what the class needs. There are two key concepts that need to get covered today: conditional rendering using ternary expressions in JSX and Browser Router.

## Learning Objectives

Review the detailed objectives in today's [student-facing readme](../README.md).

## Preparation

- Practice [the demo](../demo/city-explorer-react) to recap the week (React) and introduce the City Explorer problem domain to set them up for the next module.

## Lecture Outline

Below is the expected lecture outline and flow. One possible way to present this material is documented in the [example lecture](../facilitator/LECTURE-EXAMPLE.md) notes.

## Lab Notes

- Encourage students to 'press the buttons' and follow their curiosity. There is a lot in this lab that we have not covered, but that is likely what they will experience on the job. Talk about strategies for how they can tackle this code base.
- This lab uses a template repo for its starter code. Introduce students to how to use a template repo as part of your discussion of the starter code.

## What changed from the previous class?

- Introducing starter code

## What might students struggle with today?

- Breaking down a large code base into small pieces that they can then change and update. The starter code has a lot in it that students have never seen before. Students might struggle with understanding how different components are connected and what different parts of the code do.

## Past bugs, issues or surprises...
