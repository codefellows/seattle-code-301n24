## Overview

```md
Number and name of feature: ________________________________

Estimate of time needed to complete: _____

Start time: _____

Finish time: _____

Actual time needed to complete: _____
```

## Feature #1: Deployment

Deploy the starter code to Netlify. 

- You will need to initiate a new repository to complete this task.
- Add the URL to your live, deployed server to your README.

### Feature #2: Modify the contents

#### Why are we implementing this feature?

- As a user, I want to view a unique portfolio so that the skills and personality of the developer are portrayed.

#### What are we going to implement?

Given that a user opens the application in the browser  
When the user navigates to the home page  
Then the content should be unique and reflect the skills and personality of the developer  

#### How are we implementing it?

- Modify the contents of the template to make it your own. The JSX elements may remain the same if you like, but the content should be adapted to reflect your personal details and skills.
- Apply the following changes, some of which were part of your prework for this course:
  - Put your images in it somewhere
  - Add your name and a short, 2-3 word title.
  - Add a personal headline. This should be the same as or similar to your headline on your LinkedIn profile.
  - Make a Portfolio section and state what you are excited about in tech. Add links to projects and include placeholders for future 301 and 401 projects. If you would like, you can add links to sites such as LinkedIn and GitHub here, or social sites.
  - Make an About Me section, add your personal pitch.
- Change the content and images to reflect your personal preferences. If you are using online images, make sure they are licensed for free, commercial use. For example, [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/) has a nice variety of free images.
- Update the list of social media icons with your links using icons for your favorite social media sites from IcoMoon or Font Awesome.
- You do not have to do mulitple pages, but you can if you want to.
- Keep in mind that this template is just a starting point. It is yours to modify to reflect your personal online presence as a software developer so have fun and be creative!
