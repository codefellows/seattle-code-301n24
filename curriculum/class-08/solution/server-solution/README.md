# Solution: APIs and Promises

Refer to the [Class-08 Solution](../../class-08/solution) as a reference for grading as the core functionality and code patterns are the same as they are for this assignment.

## Lab Requirements

* Compose an Express Server
* Integrate the `/location?data=city` route as shown in demo
* Integrate the `/weather` route, from the provided .json file
* Deploy to Heroku

### Grading Standards & Notes

* Deployment
  * Live Heroku URL required for full points.
    * Partial credit available for obvious/reasonable effort even if deployment is non-working
    * Use the student supplied deployed URL to validate their code against the official City Explorer Application
  * Features / Code Standards
    * Server must have 404 and 500 error handlers
* Route definitions and handlers should be separated
* All data must be retrieved from live API

#### Lab Assistance Notes

* Students will need to supply their API keys in a .env file locally and at Heroku, in the environment variables settings area.
