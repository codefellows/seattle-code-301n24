# Facilitators Guide: The Call Stack

## Overview

Today is a hands-on class to reinfornce the concepts of modularization while introducing the idea of pagination. 

## Learning Objectives

Review the detailed objectives in today's [student-facing readme](../README.md).

## Preparation

- Review the final solution code for the City Explorer back-end and front-end.
- Prepare a 10-15 demonstration to introduce the topic of today's code challenges.
- Review the solution for the demo[demo](../demo/)

## Lecture Outline

Below is the expected lecture outline and flow. One possible way to present this material is documented in the [example lecture](../facilitator/LECTURE-EXAMPLE.md) notes.

### Warm-Up

- **Student Analysis** (5 min)
  - Show or print the [warm-up code](../warm-up/warm-up.md)
- **Debrief** (5-10 min)
  - Refer to the [Warmup Notes](../warm-up/NOTES.md)
  - Optionally demo the running code at Repl.it

### Shred Talk

- **Why**
  - Daily "Shred Talks" introduce the student to a new javascript coding concept, setting them up to complete the daily "Code Challenge" series
- **What**
  - Refer to the [challenge documentation](../challenges/README.md)
- **How** (10 min)
  - Follow the [Demo Code](../challenges/DEMO.md)
- **Note**
  - If you are short on time, this can be omitted from class lecture. There are official videos that students can watch in lieu of you leading this portion of class.

### Code Review

> Code Review for today is covered when you break the students up into groups and them work together.

### Modularization and Pagination Workshop

- **Why** (5 min)
  - students need hands on practice 
  - hearing how peers solved a problem they were struggling with is invaluable
  - being able to explain how they solved a problem to a struggling peer is essisntial to solidfying knowledge

- **What** 
  - break students up into groups of three
  - give them the starter demo code and instruct them to modularize both the front-end and the back-end
  - If students finish early, have them figure out a way to paginate the recipes
    - Give them the hint that this API uses a `from` and `to` query params
  - give them 45 minutes to an hour to do this while you check in on each group

- **How** (60 min)
  - After a break, bring the class back together and lead a discussion on the successes and challenges of that exercise
  - Go through the code and modularize both the front-end and the back-end. Be sure the spend time talking about how to deal with promises
  - Add an in-memory database to the code

- **Experimentation and Discovery Ideas**

## Lab Notes

- Today is the final day of the City Explorer Lab. Students will add an in-memory database into their server code to store location obejcts as well as add a route for movies. 

## What changed from the previous class?

- Adding an in-memory database - what that means and why we might use that. What are the drawbacks and advatages.

## What might students struggle with today?

- Understanding pagination
- Identifying which line of code corresponds to each step of the WRRC diagram

## Past bugs, issues or surprises...
