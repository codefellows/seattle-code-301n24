# Facilitators Guide: Server-side templating with EJS

## Overview

Today is the first day of the book application, a project that spans over labs 11 through 14. At some point during today's lecture, demonstrate the full solution code and point out the day-to-day features. This will give students an idea of where they are heading with their applications.

Students will work with the same partner for all four labs, so be mindful of which students are partnered together. During final projects, each team typically contains a balance of strong students and weaker students, so the book app is an opportunity to pair two strong students together and see how much they are able to accomplish.
