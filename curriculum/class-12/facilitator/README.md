- **How** (10 min)
  - Follow the [Demo Code](../challenges/DEMO.md)
- **Note**
  - If you are short on time, this can be omitted from class lecture. There are official videos that students can watch in lieu of you leading this portion of class.

## Lab Notes


## What changed from the previous class?

- Books are now stored in a database. The web server is now client to the database server.
- Students will make a call from their front-end to the back-end to collect books that they hard code into their Mongodb.

## What might students struggle with today?

- Understanding where Mongodb lives and how it is used

## Past bugs, issues or surprises...
