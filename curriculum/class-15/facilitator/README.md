# Facilitators Guide: Final Project Kick-off

## Overview

Exam and Project Week Kickoff

## Learning Objectives

Review the detailed objectives in today's [student-facing readme](../README.md).

## Preparation

- Split students into groups of no more than 5 people. A size of 3-4 is typically able to handle the workload of a 301 final project.
- Review the project proposals in Canvas before class and be prepared to discuss some of the proposed ideas.
- Review the project requirements.

## Lecture Outline

One possible way to present this material is documented in the [example lecture](./LECTURE-EXAMPLE.md) notes.

### Course Wrap-Up

Congratulate the students on making it this far! 

Remind them ... they are now "Full Stack MERN Developers"!

### Exam Prep

Students spend the lecture time of Class 15 taking the exam.

Follow the [Facilitator instructions in the exam folder](/facilitator/final-exam/FACILITATOR.md) to administer the exam.

After the time window for taking the exam is over, re-convene the class for project kickoff as described below. 

### Project Preparation

- **Why** (5 min)
  - In order to be successful in project week, organization is essential
  - Teams should be prepared to come in on the first day of project week ready to start coding
  - This removes stress and provides more time to execute
- **What** (10 min)
  - Teams should collectively agree on the basics of the project:
    - How will we work best together?
    - What are we building?
    - How are we planning to build it?
    - What will our workflow be?
- **How** (30 min)
  - Project Teams to complete a series of prep assignments

## General Comments and Notes

Today wraps up the Can of Books app and starts the transition into project week. Spend time filling in any gaps from this project so students feel prepared to complete any remaining feature tasks before final projects kick off.

There are several assignments prior to the official start of final projects: finishing and submitting the book app, the small db normalization lab, and completing the week 3 survey. There are no resubmits allowed during final projects and any student whose grade is not at 90% after final projects will need special permission to resubmit additional assignments afterwards. Depending on the timeline for enrollment in 401, the timeline for these exceptions are important and the Admissions team should be included in the conversation.
