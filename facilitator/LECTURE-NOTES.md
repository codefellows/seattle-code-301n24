# Code 301

## Day at a Glance

There are several components to the daily 301 schedule:

- Each lecture should begin with a warm-up challenge.
  - With the exception of the first and last classes, there is a warm-up folder for each day. The warm-up folder includes the `warm-up.md` for students to review in class and the `NOTES.md` which contains internal notes for the instructor.
  - Plan to spend approximately 15 minutes at the beginning of class on these challenges. Students should have their laptop lids closed and may work independently or with a nearby classmate.
  - In some classes, students will be asked to predict the outcome.
  - In some classes, students will be asked to find all the bugs in the code and how to fix them.
  - In some classes, students will view samples of code written in JavaScript, Java, Python, or C# and be asked to determine what they think the code is doing.
- Students will complete a set of code challenges each day.
  - With the exception of the last class day, which is focused on final project kickoff, students will be working through a set of code challenges. Each set focuses on string, array, or object methods or regular expressions. The goal of these challenges is to help students feel comfortable and competent working with built-in data manipulation methods.
  - The corresponding Canvas assignment is sourced from the `challenges/ASSIGNMENT.md` file for each day. This file links out to the demo code in `DEMO.md`, overview in `README.md`, and the Shred Talks playlist (<https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLVngfM2hsbi-L6G8qlWd8RyRbuTamHt3k>).
  - Briefly discuss test-driven development and inform students that they will write their own tests in 401.
  - During lecture on the first day, walk through the workflow for students to complete a challenge. Begin by running the tests and verifying that they all fail at first. Complete one challenge live in front of students and run the tests again, showing that one will pass.
  - Students should be encouraged to add, commit, and push as each test passes.
  - The challenges should take approximately 2-3 hours for students to complete. They should begin working on these challenges at the end of lecture and continue into the evening as needed.
- For classes in the daytime track, lab takes place in the morning following the lecture. Publish the lab assignment between 8:30 and 9:00 a.m. The lab assignment and corresponding retro assignment are due by 1:59 p.m. and are submitted through Canvas.

The 301 schedule with afternoon lectures is a big mindset shift for students who took 201 with morning lectures. Remind students that they should be flexible and consider the afternoon lecture schedule as a way to prepare them for their future jobs. Their boss could approach them with a task and ask for it to be completed by 2 p.m.
