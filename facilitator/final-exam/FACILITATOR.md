# Assessment Administration

At beginning of the class session, spend 30 minutes to prepare students for the assessment.

## Introducing Assessment

Thoroughly review [ASSESSMENT README](./assessment/README.md){:target="_blank"}

## Ground Rules

Communicate the following to students.

- This is a **solo** assessment.
- Online research is expected, and attribution of any utilized resources is required.
- Do NOT communicate with fellow students (or any other people) during the assessment.
- Go over the grading rubric.
  - Encourage students to prioritize tasks according to each task's points.

## Timeframe

- Students will have 4 hours to complete assessment.
- At the end of the designated time, all code must be committed to the repositories.
  - Since the assessment prep may end at various times you can also just set a specific time, say 1:30, as the end time.
- This schedule should work for N/WE students as well, as long as assessment given on Saturday.

## Permissible Questions to Instructional Team

While students are taking the exam, they may reach out to the instructor with questions. These are the allowable questions that instructors should answer:

- Grading criteria questions.
- Help setting up testing environment.
- Double checking that repos are correctly configured.
- Making sure a student grabbed all the files.
- Help extracting the zip file.
- High-level questions regarding test output.

Instructional team will **NOT** debug with students nor provide problem solving guidance.

When in doubt, students should ask the question to the instructor (not TAs), then the instructor can let them know if the question is out of bounds.

Emphasize that the intention is not to be be blocked by procedural issues.

## Notes from previous assessments

- Students spent long time getting set up.
- Students hit first bug then totally stuck.
- Lots of confusion with failing test output.
  - Especially with React Testing Library.

## Retakes

The retake policy is that a student who fails the exam may make another attempt, after talking with their instrutor.

When talking with students about the first attemp:

- Examine trends in the failing students submissions.
- Meet with failing students as a group and address any trends, common gaps, misunderstandings, etc.
- Give students until the start of the next class to complete the assessment.

Hopefully this will account for all of the students who are on track preparation wise for 401 to have passed the assessment.

## Failing the Retake

When students fail the retake, the instructor should look at their entire body of submitted work to see if the are truly on track for Code 401. If they are not, they should be guided to retaking 301, rather than advancing to a more advanced course. 

In our first iteration of Code 301, the initial plan was for "3rd try" students to work on the assessment in their "off" time during project week. This did not work well, student attention to project suffered even with strict instructions to spend full time on projects. So the decision was made to pause on the assessment until after final presentations. Instuctor met with "3rd triers" after presentations and gave them weekend to complete.

For N/WE students it likely makes sense to use the "middle" weekend for assessment retake.

## Failing the Second Retake

After 3 total attemps, a student unsuccessful in passing the assessment should not move on to Code 401.
